<h1>Roadmap</h1>
<p>The roadmap and <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/milestones">milestones</a>
define the project direction and priorities.</p>
<p>As developers on a hackable, flexible Vim, we're drawn to evermore
new ideas; but the relevance and impact of the project hinges on our ability to
balance exploration of the New with execution of the Now. If a feature doesn't
advance the current milestone, it may be postponed.
</p>

<h2>Current</h2>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/milestone/10">0.2</a></h3>

<ul>
    <li>GUI</li>
    <li>Windows support</li>
    <li>Pre-packaged "RelWithDebInfo" build for Windows</li>
    <li>Pre-built binaries for non-Windows platforms (tentative)</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/milestone/11">0.3</a></h3>

<ul>
    <li>Lua host, lua becomes a runtime dependency, shipped with the core editor</li>
    <li>Basic support for LSP et al.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Meta</h2>
<p>
There are <em>release</em> milestones and <em>meta</em> milestones ("buckets").
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Version-number milestones (<code>0.1</code>, <code>0.2</code>, <code>0.3</code>, â€¦)
      assign issues to production releases.<ul>
        <li>The nearest upcoming version is assigned a target date.</li>
        <li>Low-risk fixes in the current branch are first committed to the
            stable branch, then merged to master. For example, if the current
            stable release is <code>0.1.1</code> and a bug-fix is assigned to the
            <code>0.2</code> milestone, it does not mean users need to wait until
            <code>0.2</code> to get the fix. The patch will be committed to the
            stable branch and released in <code>0.1.2</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em><a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/milestones/todo">todo</a></em>
      is a bucket for triaged tickets which should be on the
      roadmap but cannot yet be assigned to a concrete milestone.</li>
  <li><em><a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/milestones/unplanned">unplanned</a></em>
      is a bucket for low-priority items or items lacking a
      feasible path to completion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Completed</h2>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/milestone/5">0.1</a></h3>
<p>The primary goal of the <code>0.1</code> release ("first public release") is to reach a
stable, functional baseline that can be built upon and used as a benchmark for
further progress. Releasing a stable product to a larger audience will increase
feedback on potential "blind spots" and will signal the most effective
direction for the project.</p>
